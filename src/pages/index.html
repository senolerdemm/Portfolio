                <h3>Easy Trip Website
                </h3>
                <p>I developed the Easy Trip project using .NET MVC, Entity Framework, and PostgreSQL to create a dynamic blog platform. The project includes full CRUD operations, allowing users to create, edit, and manage blog posts.

Key Features:
Admin Panel: A comprehensive admin dashboard for managing blog content, users, and comments.
User Interaction: Users can leave comments, engage with blog content, and interact dynamically.
Entity Framework Integration: Efficient database management with PostgreSQL.
MVC Architecture: Clean separation of concerns for better maintainability and scalability.
This project showcases my expertise in .NET development, MVC pattern, and relational databases while demonstrating my ability to build interactive and user-friendly web applications. ðŸš€</p>

                <h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
                <p>The Credit Card Fraud Detection project leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in financial systems. The goal is to develop an intelligent model that can detect anomalies and prevent financial fraud by analyzing transaction patterns.

Key Features:
Supervised Learning Approach: Trained on a labeled dataset containing legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Data Processing & Feature Engineering: Preprocessing steps include data cleaning, handling imbalanced data, and feature selection.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to detect fraud.
Evaluation Metrics: Used metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to measure model performance.
Deployment: Can be integrated into real-time financial systems to flag suspicious transactions.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with Machine Learning, data analysis, and fraud detection systems, showcasing skills in Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and model optimization techniques. ðŸš€</p>

                <h3>Plane Shooter Game</h3>
                <p>Description:
The Plane Shooter Game is a 3D action game developed using Unity. The player controls an aircraft that can fire projectiles (bombs) to destroy enemies. The game features realistic physics, dynamic camera movements, and a scoring system based on enemy destruction. The project involved implementing rigid body physics, object pooling for bullets, and collision detection to create a smooth gameplay experience.

Technologies Used:

Unity (C#) for game mechanics and physics
Blender for 3D modeling of aircraft and projectiles
RigidBody physics for realistic movement
Object Pooling for efficient bullet and enemy spawning
Camera Follow System to track the playerâ€™s movement
Key Features:

Aircraft movement and shooting mechanics
Real-time physics interactions
Dynamic enemy AI that follows the player
Endless gameplay mode with increasing difficulty
Score system based on destroyed enemies</p>

                <h3>Endless Runner Game</h3>
                <p>Description:
The Endless Runner Game is a fast-paced arcade-style game where the player continuously runs forward while avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups. The game features procedural level generation to ensure a unique experience in every session. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases by speeding up the playerâ€™s movement and introducing more complex obstacles.

Technologies Used:

Unity (C#) for game development
Procedural Generation for infinite gameplay
Physics-based obstacles and dynamic collisions
UI System for displaying scores and in-game stats
Mobile Support with touch and tilt controls
Key Features:

Randomized obstacle placement for replayability
Power-ups to enhance player abilities
Increasing difficulty as the game progresses
Leaderboard and high-score system
Smooth animations and particle effects
These projects demonstrate game development skills, object-oriented programming, physics-based mechanics, and dynamic user interaction. Let me know if you want further refinements!</p>
